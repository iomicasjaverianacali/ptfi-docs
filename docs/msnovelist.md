# MSNovelist: de novo structure generation from mass spectra

Usage on tandem mass spectroscopy ($MS^{2}$)

## Architecture

Encoder-Decoder

## Results

- 3863 $MS^{2}$ from Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPSM)
- Accuracy 25% on first rank
- Accuracy 45% overall
- Reproduced 61% of correct database annotations without having ever seen the structure in the training phase.

## Use case

*MSNovelist is ideally suited to complement library-based annotation in the case of
poorly represented analyte classes and novel compounds*.
